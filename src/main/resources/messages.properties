t.what.for.co2.am.long.descr=Once you have calculated the CO₂ emissions of your trip, it is important to do something with it.   \
  There are many options online to easily offset your emissions. However, there is also a disadvantage with CO₂ compensation; \
  you do not reverse the pollution with it. The CO₂ emitted by your journey is in the air and no matter how \
  \  many trees you plant, the specific CO₂ remains in the air. It is best to calculate the CO₂ before your \
   trip and choose the  most sustainable trip based on that. This way you ensure in advance that too many \
  emissions do not end up in the air and that you no longer have to compensate anything.

calc.co2.car.jorn=Calculate the CO₂ emissions of your car journey
tt.long.tldr.desc=\  When calculating the CO₂ emissions of your trip, there are also small things that are important for \
  \ the  calculation. For example, when you travel by car, you need more fuel if you have a caravan behind your exhaust or \
  \ if you have a roof box or bicycle rack with you. In general, the more weight you carry, the more polluting the  \
  car journey is and the more CO₂ your car emits. There are a number of standard calculations that you  can use when \
  \ traveling by car. For example, with diesel you emit an average of 132 gr of CO₂ per kilometer, while with petrol this is 120 CO₂\
  per kilometer . These emissions are calculated on average consumption. This can therefore differ greatly based on weight and car.
